## Facial Recognition using Siamese Model

A Facial Recognition model from scratch using Tensorflow and OpenCV. Tensorflow was used for the training of model and evaluation of model while OpenCV was used for generating images and data pre-processing. Step by step processes are included for easier understanding of concepts.
